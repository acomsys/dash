# Learnings

1. For optimization purposes, always ensure that useStore queries are as atomic as possible.

   Use this:

   ```js
   const count = useDashStore((s) => s.count); // 🙅‍♂️
   ```

   Not this:

   ```js
   const { count } = useDashStore((s) => s); // 👍
   ```

1. Do not have a component that queries too many things. A change in any of those things will cause the entire component to re-render.

   ```js
   const DashboardLayout = ({ children }: React.PropsWithChildren<{}>) => {
      // 🙅‍♂️ move this to a component dedicated to displaying counter
      const count = useDashStore((s) => s.count);

      // 🙅‍♂️ move this to a component dedicated to displaying list of directories
      const directories = useDashStore((s) => s.dash.directories);

      // 👍 actions are fine since they don't change often
      const { push } = useDirectoryService();
      const { increment, decrement } = useDashStore((store) => ({
         increment: store.increment,
         decrement: store.decrement,
      }));
      // ...
   ```

1. Break apart components that have many queries in to many smaller components with each of the smaller components querying specific things from the store.
1. For testability always make a stateless and stateful versions of a component. The stateful version simply invoking the stateless version.
1. Subscribe to the store from the stateful version and pass the state to the stateless version.
1. Implement tests using the stateless versions of the components.

# Create T3 App

This is an app bootstrapped according to the [init.tips](https://init.tips) stack, also known as the T3-Stack.

## Why are there `.js` files in here?

As per [T3-Axiom #3](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app/tree/next#3-typesafety-isnt-optional), we believe take typesafety as a first class citizen. Unfortunately, not all frameworks and plugins support TypeScript which means some of the configuration files have to be `.js` files.

We try to emphasize that these files are javascript for a reason, by explicitly declaring its type (`cjs` or `mjs`) depending on what's supported by the library it is used by. Also, all the `js` files in this project are still typechecked using a `@ts-check` comment at the top.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with the most basic configuration and then move on to more advanced configuration.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.

- [Next-Auth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io) (using @next version? [see v10 docs here](https://alpha.trpc.io))

## How do I deploy this?

### Vercel

We recommend deploying to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=t3-oss&utm_campaign=oss). It makes it super easy to deploy NextJs apps.

- Push your code to a GitHub repository.
- Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/?utm_source=t3-oss&utm_campaign=oss) and sign up with GitHub.
- Create a Project and import the repository you pushed your code to.
- Add your environment variables.
- Click **Deploy**
- Now whenever you push a change to your repository, Vercel will automatically redeploy your website!

### Docker

You can also dockerize this stack and deploy a container.

1. In your [next.config.mjs](./next.config.mjs), add the `output: "standalone"` option to your config.
2. Create a `.dockerignore` file with the following contents:
   <details>
   <summary>.dockerignore</summary>

   ```
   Dockerfile
   .dockerignore
   node_modules
   npm-debug.log
   README.md
   .next
   .git
   ```

  </details>

3. Create a `Dockerfile` with the following contents:
   <details>
   <summary>Dockerfile</summary>

   ```Dockerfile
   # Install dependencies only when needed
   FROM node:16-alpine AS deps
   # Check https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/tree/b4117f9333da4138b03a546ec926ef50a31506c3#nodealpine to understand why libc6-compat might be needed.
   RUN apk add --no-cache libc6-compat
   WORKDIR /app

   # Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager
   COPY package.json yarn.lock* package-lock.json* pnpm-lock.yaml* ./
   RUN \
      if [ -f yarn.lock ]; then yarn --frozen-lockfile; \
      elif [ -f package-lock.json ]; then npm ci; \
      elif [ -f pnpm-lock.yaml ]; then yarn global add pnpm && pnpm i; \
      else echo "Lockfile not found." && exit 1; \
      fi


   # Rebuild the source code only when needed
   FROM node:16-alpine AS builder
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
   COPY . .

   # Next.js collects completely anonymous telemetry data about general usage.
   # Learn more here: https://nextjs.org/telemetry
   # Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry during the build.
   # ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

   RUN yarn build

   # If using npm comment out above and use below instead
   # RUN npm run build

   # Production image, copy all the files and run next
   FROM node:16-alpine AS runner
   WORKDIR /app

   ENV NODE_ENV production
   # Uncomment the following line in case you want to disable telemetry during runtime.
   # ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

   RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
   RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

   # You only need to copy next.config.js if you are NOT using the default configuration
   # COPY --from=builder /app/next.config.js ./
   COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
   COPY --from=builder /app/package.json ./package.json

   # Automatically leverage output traces to reduce image size
   # https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing
   COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone ./
   COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static

   USER nextjs

   EXPOSE 3000

   ENV PORT 3000

   CMD ["node", "server.js"]
   ```

  </details>

4. You can now build an image to deploy yourself, or use a PaaS such as [Railway's](https://railway.app) automated [Dockerfile deployments](https://docs.railway.app/deploy/dockerfiles) to deploy your app.
